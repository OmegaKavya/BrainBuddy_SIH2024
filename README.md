## 🛠 Tech Stack & Project Structure  
- **Frontend**: Plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript (no frameworks) — each page is self-contained and deployable.  
- **Deployment**: Hosted via GitHub Pages — just place files in the root and you’re live.  
- **Navigation**: Relative paths used to ensure pages link properly on GitHub Pages (e.g., `window.location.href = 'index.html';`).

## ✏️ Features  
- Gamified UI/UX: Earn points, track your streaks and level up.  
- Minimalistic and fast: Lightweight static pages for instant load times.  
- Modular content: Easily extendable with new topics, cheat-sheets and quizzes.  
- Easy deployment: Upload to GitHub, Netlify or Vercel — zero build step required.

## ✅ Why It Matters  
In an era where attention is divided, BrainBuddy transforms studying into a **motivating journey** rather than a chore. By combining gamification with focused content delivery, this tool helps learners stay engaged, build momentum and enjoy the process of mastering topics.
